Playmaker - Visual scripting for Unity
------------------------------------------------------

PLEASE BACKUP PROJECTS BEFORE UPDATING PLAYMAKER!!

NOTE: The Playmaker/Asset Store license is for a single user. 
Multiple users need multiple licenses!

------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:
------------------------------------------------------

To install PlayMaker import all files from the unitypackage.

Download Sample Scenes at www.hutonggames.com/tutorials.html

NOTE: IMPORT SAMPLE SCENES INTO A NEW PROJECT TO AVOID OVERWRITING YOUR PROJECT FILES!!

UNITY 5 NOTES:
------------------------------------------------------

The 1.7.8 update includes compatibility fixes for Unity 5.
The 1.8.0 update is currently in beta and includes:
- Performance enhancements for Unity5.
- Windows Store support.
- Lots of new features!

Please email info@hutonggames.com for access to the beta.
We will need your invoice number and a google/gmail address to send the beta invite to.

NOTE: Unity 5 no longer supports component shortcuts in GameObject (e.g., guiTexture, renderer etc.).
If you used these properties in Get Property or Set Property actions you will need to re-select the property!
Problem: If you dragged a GameObject into Set Property and navigated into the guiTexture property, the resulting path is no longer valid in Unity 5.
Solution: Drag the component itself into the property field (not the GameObject).

UPGRADE NOTES:
------------------------------------------------------

To Upgrade:

- Backup your project.
- Import the latest playmaker.unitypackage.
- Restart Unity.

Obsolete Actions: 

After updating, you may get errors about obsolete actions in your saved projects. Obsolete actions should still work, but it is recommended that you upgrade them to the suggested action. You can turn off this check in Preferences. Obsolete actions are also hidden by default in the Action Browser. You can toggle this setting in the Action Browser settings menu.

Updated Actions:

After loading a project/scene you may get a notification in the Unity Console that actions have changed. Open the PlayMaker Editor Log to get more info on these changes. Most of the time Actions are updated automatically, and any new parameters are given default values. However, occasionally an action is incompatible and you will need to edit its settings. The Console window lets you quickly find and fix these Actions.

Thanks and have fun with Playmaker!
